# Mangalore Bus Guide

The Mangalore Bus Guide is a web application that provides information about various buses operating in Mangalore. This project consists of a **backend** built with **Express.js** and a **frontend** created with **Vite** and **React**. It allows users to view bus routes, numbers, and their respective stops, and includes a **search feature** to easily find buses by their number, starting point, destination, or route.

## Features

- **Search Option**: A search input that filters buses based on bus number, origin, destination, or any route name.
- **Dynamic Bus Data**: Data is fetched from a backend API and dynamically displayed in the frontend.
- **Frontend**: Built using **Vite** and **React**, ensuring fast page loads and efficient rendering.
- **Backend**: A simple **Express.js** server that serves bus data through an API.

## Learnings

- **Backend Development with Express.js**: I learned how to set up a backend server using Express.js, including handling HTTP requests and sending JSON responses.
- **Frontend Development with React and Vite**: I gained experience with React for building dynamic components and Vite for fast development server setup and bundling.
- **CORS Handling**: I learned how to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in Express.js to allow communication between the frontend and backend running on different ports.
- **State Management in React**: I understood how to manage state in React using `useState` and `useEffect`, particularly for managing and displaying bus data fetched from an API.
- **Search Functionality**: I implemented a search feature that filters a list of buses based on various criteria like bus number, start and end locations, or route names.
